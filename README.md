# Web-Engineering-and-Development-Project
The 'Words-Game' is a game that tests your writing speed by typing the sentence at a specific time, and if you type it correctly within the time you will get a point, and if you misspell it you will lose a life.

NOTE: To run the project you have to download XAMPP.

**********************************
The 'Words-Game' project is for the Web Engineering and Development course at JIC.
