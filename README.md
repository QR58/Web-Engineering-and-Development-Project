The 'Words-Game' is a game that tests your writing speed by typing the sentence at a specific time, and if you type it correctly within the time you will get a point, and if you misspell it you will lose a life.

**********************************
The 'Words-Game' project is for the Web Engineering and Development course at JIC.
